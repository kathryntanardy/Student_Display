# Assignment 2: Student Display Website

```python
Included below is some description of the features I have included in this assignment
```

## Home ("/students/view")

```python
The form of rectangles is showcased in this page. Here, the header of each students will change depending on their hairColor attribute, and the other necessary information are included in each id. I made the display as it was an ID card for each students. Also, inside each cards, there are an 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons. 'Edit' will redirect the user to an edit page for tht specific student, while 'Delete' will just immediately remove the Student from the database and the corresponding display.
```

## Add Student ("add.html")

```python
This is the form where the user can add new Students information. 
```

## Table ("students/display")

```python
This is where all of the Students in the database are displayed as a table form. 
```
